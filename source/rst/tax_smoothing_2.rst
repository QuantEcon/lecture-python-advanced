An Application of Markov Jump Linear Quadratic Dynamic Programming
==================================================================

This is a :doc:`sequel to an earlier lecture <tax_smoothing_1>`.

We use a method introduced in lecture :doc:`Markov Jump LQ dynamic programming <markov_jump_lq>` to
implement suggestions by Barro (1999 :cite:`barro1999determinants`, 2003 :cite:`barro2003religion`) for extending his
classic 1979 model of tax smoothing.

Barro’s 1979 :cite:`Barro1979` model is about a government that borrows and lends in order
to help it minimize an intertemporal measure of distortions caused by
taxes.

Technically, Barro’s 1979 :cite:`Barro1979` model looks a lot like a consumption-smoothing model.

Our generalizations of his 1979 :cite:`Barro1979` model will also look
like souped-up consumption-smoothing models.

Wanting tractability induced Barro in 1979 :cite:`Barro1979` to assume that

-  the government trades only one-period risk-free debt, and

-  the one-period risk-free interest rate is constant

In our :doc:`earlier lecture<tax_smoothing_1>`, we relaxed the second of these assumptions but not the first.

In particular, we used *Markov jump linear quadratic dynamic programming*
to allow the exogenous interest rate to vary over time.

In this lecture, we add a maturity composition decision to the
government’s problem by expanding the dimension of the state.

We assume

-  that the government borrows or saves in the form of risk-free bonds
   of maturities :math:`1, 2, \ldots , H`.

-  that interest rates on those bonds are time-varying and in particular are
   governed by a jointly stationary stochastic process.

Let's start with some standard imports:

.. code-block:: ipython

    import quantecon as qe
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline

Two example specifications
==========================


We’ll describe two possible specifications

-  In one, each period the government issues zero-coupon
   bonds of one- and two-period maturities and redeems them only when
   they mature -- in this version, the maturity structure of government
   debt at each date is partly inherited from the past.

-  In the second, the government redesigns the maturity
   structure of the debt each period.

One- and Two-period Bonds but No Restructuring
=================================================

Let :math:`T_t` denote tax collections, :math:`\beta` a discount factor,
:math:`b_{t,t+1}` time :math:`t+1` goods that the government promises to
pay at :math:`t`, :math:`b_{t,t+2}` time :math:`t+2` goods that the
government promises to pay at time :math:`t`, :math:`G_t` government
purchases, :math:`p_{t,t+1}` the number of time :math:`t` goods received
per time :math:`t+1` goods promised, and :math:`p_{t,t+2}` the number of
time :math:`t` goods received per time :math:`t+2` goods promised.

Evidently, :math:`p_{t, t+1}, p_{t,t+2}` are inversely related to
appropriate corresponding gross interest rates on government debt.

In the spirit of Barro (1979) :cite:`Barro1979`, government
expenditures are governed by an exogenous stochastic process.

Given initial conditions :math:`b_{-2,0}, b_{-1,0}, z_0, i_0`, where
:math:`i_0` is the initial Markov state, the government chooses a
contingency plan for :math:`\{b_{t, t+1}, b_{t,t+2}, T_t\}_{t=0}^\infty`
to maximize.

.. math::  - E_0 \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t \left[ T_t^2 + c_1( b_{t,t+1} - b_{t,t+2})^2 \right]

subject to the constraints

.. math:: \begin{aligned}
 T_t & = G_t + b_{t-2,t} + b_{t-1,t} - p_{t,t+2} b_{t,t+2} - p_{t,t+1} b_{t,t+1} \cr
   G_t &  = U_{g,s_t} z_t \cr
   z_{t+1} & = A_{22,s_t} z_t + C_{2,s_t} w_{t+1} \cr
   \begin{bmatrix}
    p_{t,t+1} \cr
    p_{t,t+2} \cr
    U_{g,s_t} \cr
    A_{22,s_t} \cr
    C_{2,s_t}
   \end{bmatrix} & \sim \textrm{functions of Markov state with transition matrix } \Pi \end{aligned}


Here :math:`w_{t+1} \sim {\cal N}(0,I)` and :math:`\Pi_{ij}` is
the probability that the Markov state moves from state :math:`i` to
state :math:`j` in one period.

The variables
:math:`T_t, b_{t, t+1}, b_{t,t+2}` are *control* variables chosen at
:math:`t`, while the variables :math:`b_{t-1,t}, b_{t-2,t}` are
endogenous state variables inherited from the past at time :math:`t` and
:math:`p_{t,t+1}, p_{t,t+2}` are exogenous state variables at time
:math:`t`.

The parameter :math:`c_1` imposes a penalty on the government’s issuing
different quantities of one and two-period debt.

This penalty deters the
government from taking large “long-short” positions in debt of different
maturities. An example below will show this in action.

As well as extending the model to allow for a maturity decision for
government debt, we can also in principle allow the matrices
:math:`U_{g,s_t}, A_{22,s_t}, C_{2,s_t}` to depend on the Markov state :math:`s_t`.

Below, we will often adopt the convention that for matrices appearing in a linear state space,
:math:`A_t \equiv A_{s_t}, C_t \equiv C_{s_t}` and so on, so that dependence on :math:`t` is always
intermediated through the Markov state :math:`s_t`. 

Mapping into an LQ Markov Jump Problem
===========================================================

First, define

.. math::  \hat b_t = b_{t-1,t} + b_{t-2,t} ,

which is debt due at time :math:`t`.

Then define the endogenous part of the state:

.. math::

    \bar b_t = \begin{bmatrix}
     \hat b_t \cr
       b_{t-1,t+1}
    \end{bmatrix}

and the complete state

.. math::

    x_t = \begin{bmatrix} \bar b_t \cr
            z_t
          \end{bmatrix}

and the control vector

.. math::

    u_{t} =  \begin{bmatrix}
       b_{t,t+1} \cr
       b_{t,t+2}
      \end{bmatrix}

The endogenous part of state vector follows the law of motion:

.. math::

    \begin{bmatrix}
       \hat b_{t+1} \cr
       b_{t,t+2}
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
       0 & 1 \cr
       0 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
     \hat b_{t} \cr
     b_{t-1,t+1}
    \end{bmatrix}
   +
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \cr
      0 & 1 \cr
     \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
       b_{t,t+1} \cr
       b_{t,t+2}
      \end{bmatrix}

or

.. math::  \bar b_{t+1} = A_{11} \bar b_t + B_1 u_t

Define the following functions of the state

.. math::  G_t = S_{G,t} x_t, \quad \hat b_t = S_1 x_t

and

.. math::  M_t  =  \begin{bmatrix} - p_{t,t+1} & - p_{t,t+2} \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`p_{t,t+1}` is the discount on one period loans in the
discrete Markov state at time :math:`t` and :math:`p_{t,t+2}` is the
discount on two-period loans in the discrete Markov state.

Define

.. math::  S_t = S_{G,t} + S_1

Note that in discrete Markov state :math:`i`

.. math::  T_t = M_t u_t + S_t x_t

It follows that

.. math::  T_t^2 = x_t' S_t' S_t x_t + u_t' M_t' M_t u_t + 2 u_t' M_t' S_t x_t

or

.. math::   T_t^2 = x_t'R_t x_t + u_t' Q_t u_t + 2 u_t' W_t x_t

where

.. math::  R_t = S_t'S_t, \quad Q_t = M_t' M_t, \quad  W_t = M_t' S_t

Because the payoff function also includes the penalty parameter on
issuing debt of different maturities, we have:

.. math::  T_t^2 + c_1( b_{t,t+1} - b_{t,t+2})^2 = x_t'R_t x_t + u_t' Q_t u_t + 2 u_t' W_t x_t +  c_1 u_t'Q^c u_t

where :math:`Q^c = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}`. Therefore, the overall :math:`Q` matrix for the Markov jump LQ problem is:

.. math::  Q_t^c = Q_t + c_1Q^c

The law of motion of the state in all discrete Markov states :math:`i`
is

.. math::  x_{t+1} = A_t x_t +  B u_t +  C_t w_{t+1}

where

.. math::

    A_t = \begin{bmatrix}  A_{11} & 0 \cr
                            0 & A_{22,t}
          \end{bmatrix}, \quad
           B = \begin{bmatrix}
                      B_1 \cr
                      0
                     \end{bmatrix}, \quad
            C_t = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \cr C_{2,t} \end{bmatrix}

Thus, in this problem all the matrices apart from :math:`B` may depend
on the Markov state at time :math:`t`.


As shown in the :doc:`previous lecture <tax_smoothing_1>`,
the ``LQMarkov`` class can solve Markov jump LQ problems when provided with the
:math:`A, B, C, R, Q, W` matrices for each Markov state.

The function below maps the primitive matrices and parameters from the above
two-period model into the matrices that the ``LQMarkov`` class requires:

.. code-block:: python3

    def LQ_markov_mapping(A22, C2, Ug, p1, p2, c1=0):

        """
        Function which takes A22, C2, Ug, p_{t, t+1}, p_{t, t+2} and penalty
        parameter c1, and returns the required matrices for the LQMarkov
        model: A, B, C, R, Q, W.
        This version uses the condensed version of the endogenous state.
        """

        # Make sure all matrices can be treated as 2D arrays
        A22 = np.atleast_2d(A22)
        C2 = np.atleast_2d(C2)
        Ug = np.atleast_2d(Ug)
        p1 = np.atleast_2d(p1)
        p2 = np.atleast_2d(p2)

        # Find the number of states (z) and shocks (w)
        nz, nw = C2.shape

        # Create A11, B1, S1, S2, Sg, S matrices
        A11 = np.zeros((2, 2))
        A11[0, 1] = 1

        B1 = np.eye(2)

        S1 = np.hstack((np.eye(1), np.zeros((1, nz+1))))
        Sg = np.hstack((np.zeros((1, 2)), Ug))
        S = S1 + Sg

        # Create M matrix
        M = np.hstack((-p1, -p2))

        # Create A, B, C matrices
        A_T = np.hstack((A11, np.zeros((2, nz))))
        A_B = np.hstack((np.zeros((nz, 2)), A22))
        A = np.vstack((A_T, A_B))

        B = np.vstack((B1, np.zeros((nz, 2))))

        C = np.vstack((np.zeros((2, nw)), C2))

        # Create Q^c matrix
        Qc = np.array([[1, -1], [-1, 1]])

        # Create R, Q, W matrices

        R = S.T @ S
        Q = M.T @ M + c1 * Qc
        W = M.T @ S

        return A, B, C, R, Q, W

With the above function, we can proceed to solve the model in two steps:

1. Use ``LQ_markov_mapping`` to map
   :math:`U_{g,t}, A_{22,t}, C_{2,t}, p_{t,t+1}, p_{t,t+2}` into the
   :math:`A, B, C, R, Q, W` matrices for each of the :math:`n` Markov states.

2. Use the ``LQMarkov`` class to solve the resulting n-state Markov
   jump LQ problem.

Penalty on Different Issuance Across Maturities
================================================

To implement a simple example of the two-period model, we assume that
:math:`G_t` follows an AR(1) process:

.. math::  G_{t+1} = \bar G + \rho G_t + \sigma w_{t+1}

To do this, we set :math:`z_t = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ G_t \end{bmatrix}`,
and consequently:

.. math::  A_{22} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \bar G & \rho \end{bmatrix} \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm} C_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \sigma \end{bmatrix} \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm} U_g = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}

Therefore, in this example, :math:`A_{22}, C_2` and :math:`U_g` are not
time-varying.

We will assume that there are two Markov states, one with a
flatter yield curve, and one with a steeper yield curve. In state 1,
prices are:

.. math::  p^1_{t,t+1} = \beta \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm} p^1_{t,t+2} = \beta^2 - 0.02

and in state 2, prices are:

.. math::  p^2_{t,t+1} = \beta \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm}  p^2_{t,t+2} = \beta^2 + 0.02

We first solve the model with no penalty parameter on different issuance
across maturities, i.e. :math:`c_1 = 0`.

We also need to specify a
transition matrix for the Markov state, we use:

.. math::  \Pi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.9 & 0.1 \\ 0.1 & 0.9 \end{bmatrix}

Thus, each Markov state is persistent, and there is an equal chance of
moving from one to the other.

.. code-block:: python3

    # Model parameters
    β, Gbar, ρ, σ, c1 = 0.95, 5, 0.8, 1, 0
    p1, p2, p3, p4 = β, β**2 - 0.02, β, β**2 + 0.02

    # Basic model matrices
    A22 = np.array([[1, 0], [Gbar, ρ] ,])
    C_2 = np.array([[0], [σ]])
    Ug = np.array([[0, 1]])

    A1, B1, C1, R1, Q1, W1 = LQ_markov_mapping(A22, C_2, Ug, p1, p2, c1)
    A2, B2, C2, R2, Q2, W2 = LQ_markov_mapping(A22, C_2, Ug, p3, p4, c1)

    # Small penalties on debt required to implement no-Ponzi scheme
    R1[0, 0] = R1[0, 0] + 1e-9
    R2[0, 0] = R2[0, 0] + 1e-9

    # Construct lists of matrices correspond to each state
    As = [A1, A2]
    Bs = [B1, B2]
    Cs = [C1, C2]
    Rs = [R1, R2]
    Qs = [Q1, Q2]
    Ws = [W1, W2]

    Π = np.array([[0.9, 0.1],
                  [0.1, 0.9]])

    # Construct and solve the model using the LQMarkov class
    lqm = qe.LQMarkov(Π, Qs, Rs, As, Bs, Cs=Cs, Ns=Ws, beta=β)
    lqm.stationary_values()

    # Simulate the model
    x0 = np.array([[100, 50, 1, 10]])
    x, u, w, t = lqm.compute_sequence(x0, ts_length=300)

    # Plot of one and two-period debt issuance
    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))
    ax1.plot(u[0, :])
    ax1.set_title('One-period debt issuance')
    ax1.set_xlabel('Time')
    ax2.plot(u[1, :])
    ax2.set_title('Two-period debt issuance')
    ax2.set_xlabel('Time')
    plt.show()

The above simulations show that when no penalty is imposed on different
issuances across maturities, the government has an incentive to take
large “long-short” positions in debt of different maturities.

To prevent such an outcome, we now set :math:`c_1 = 0.01`.

This penalty is enough
to ensure that the government issues positive quantities of both one and
two-period debt:

.. code-block:: python3

    # Put small penalty on different issuance across maturities
    c1 = 0.01

    A1, B1, C1, R1, Q1, W1 = LQ_markov_mapping(A22, C_2, Ug, p1, p2, c1)
    A2, B2, C2, R2, Q2, W2 = LQ_markov_mapping(A22, C_2, Ug, p3, p4, c1)

    # Small penalties on debt required to implement no-Ponzi scheme
    R1[0, 0] = R1[0, 0] + 1e-9
    R2[0, 0] = R2[0, 0] + 1e-9

    # Construct lists of matrices
    As = [A1, A2]
    Bs = [B1, B2]
    Cs = [C1, C2]
    Rs = [R1, R2]
    Qs = [Q1, Q2]
    Ws = [W1, W2]

    # Construct and solve the model using the LQMarkov class
    lqm2 = qe.LQMarkov(Π, Qs, Rs, As, Bs, Cs=Cs, Ns=Ws, beta=β)
    lqm2.stationary_values()

    # Simulate the model
    x, u, w, t = lqm2.compute_sequence(x0, ts_length=300)

    # Plot of one and two-period debt issuance
    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))
    ax1.plot(u[0, :])
    ax1.set_title('One-period debt issuance')
    ax1.set_xlabel('Time')
    ax2.plot(u[1, :])
    ax2.set_title('Two-period debt issuance')
    ax2.set_xlabel('Time')
    plt.show()

A Model with Restructuring
==========================

This model alters two features of the previous model:

1. The maximum horizon of government debt is now extended to a general
   *H* periods.

2. The government is able to redesign the maturity structure of debt
   every period.

We impose a cost on adjusting issuance of each maturity by amending the
payoff function to become:

.. math::  T_t^2 + \sum_{j=0}^{H-1} c_2 (b_{t+j}^{t-1} - b_{t+j+1}^t)^2

The government’s budget constraint is now:

.. math::

  T_t + \sum_{j=1}^Hp_{t,t+j} b_{t+j}^t = b_t^{t-1} + \sum_{j=1}^{H-1} p_{t,t+j} b_{t+j}^{t-1} + G_t


To map this into the Markov Jump LQ framework, we define state and
control variables.

Let:

.. math::  \bar b_t = \begin{bmatrix} b^{t-1}_t \\ b^{t-1}_{t+1} \\ \vdots \\  b^{t-1}_{t+H-1} \end{bmatrix} \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm} u_t = \begin{bmatrix} b^{t}_{t+1} \\ b^{t}_{t+2} \\ \vdots \\  b^{t}_{t+H} \end{bmatrix}

Thus, :math:`\bar b_t` is the endogenous state (debt issued last period)
and :math:`u_t` is the control (debt issued today).

As before, we will
also have the exogenous state :math:`z_t`, which determines government
spending.

Therefore, the full state is:

.. math::  x_t = \begin{bmatrix} \bar b_t \\ z_t \end{bmatrix}

We also define a vector :math:`p_t` that contains the time :math:`t`
price of goods in period :math:`t + j`:

.. math:: p_t = \begin{bmatrix} p_{t,t+1} \\ p_{t,t+2} \\ \vdots \\  p_{t,t+H} \end{bmatrix}

Finally, we define three useful matrices :math:`S_s, S_x, \tilde S_x`:

.. math::  \begin{bmatrix} p_{t,t+1} \\ p_{t,t+2} \\ \vdots \\  p_{t,t+H-1} \end{bmatrix} = S_s p_t \text{ where } S_s = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & & \ddots & & \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & 0  \end{bmatrix}

.. math::  \begin{bmatrix} b^{t-1}_{t+1} \\ b^{t-1}_{t+2} \\ \vdots \\  b^{t-1}_{t+T-1} \end{bmatrix} = S_x \bar b_t  \text{ where } S_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & &  & \ddots & \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix}

.. math::  b^{t-1}_t = \tilde S_x \bar b_t \text{ where } \tilde S_x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \end{bmatrix}

In terms of dimensions, the first two matrices defined above are :math:`(H-1) \times H`.

The last is :math:`1 \times H`

We can now write the government’s budget constraint in matrix notation.
Rearranging the government budget constraint gives:

.. math::  T_t = b_t^{t-1} + \sum_{j=1}^{H-1} p_{t+j}^t b_{t+j}^{t-1} + G_t - \sum_{j=1}^H p_{t+j}^t b_{t+j}^t

or

.. math::

    T_t = \tilde S_x \bar b_t + (S_s p_t) \cdot (S_x \bar b_t) + U_g z_t - p_t \cdot u_t


If we want to write this in terms of the full state, we have:

.. math::  T_t = \begin{bmatrix}  (\tilde S_x + p_t'S_s'S_x) & Ug \end{bmatrix} x_t - p_t' u_t

To simplify the notation, let :math:`S_t = \begin{bmatrix}  (\tilde S_x + p_t’S_s’S_x) & Ug \end{bmatrix}`.

Then

.. math::  T_t = S_t x_t - p_t' u_t

Therefore

.. math::  T_t^2 = x_t' R_t x_t + u_t ' Q_t u_t + 2 u_t'W_t x_t

where

.. math::  R_t = S_t'S_t , \hspace{5mm} Q_t = p_t p_t' , \hspace{5mm} W_t = -p_t S_t

where to economize on notation we adopt the convention that for the linear state matrices
:math:`R_t \equiv R_{s_t}, Q_t \equiv W_{s_t}` and so on.

We'll continue to use this convention also for the linear state matrices :math:`A, B, W` and so on below. 

Because the payoff function also includes the penalty parameter for
rescheduling, we have:

.. math::  T_t^2 + \sum_{j=0}^{H-1} c_2 (b_{t+j}^{t-1} - b_{t+j+1}^t)^2 = T_t^2 + c_2(\bar b_t - u_t)'(\bar b_t - u_t)

Because the complete state is :math:`x_t` and not :math:`\bar b_t`, we
rewrite this as:

.. math::  T_t^2 + c_2(S_c x_t - u_t)'(S_c x_t - u_t)

where :math:`S_c = \begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \end{bmatrix}`

Multiplying this out gives:

.. math::  T_t^2 + c_2 x_t' S_c' S_c x_t - 2c_2 u_t' S_c x_t + c_2 u_t'u_t

Therefore, with the cost term, we must amend our :math:`R,Q,W` matrices
as follows:

.. math::  R^c_t = R_t + c_2 S_c'S_c

.. math::  Q^c_t = Q_t + c_2 I

.. math::  W^c_t = W_t - c_2 S_c

To finish mapping into the Markov jump LQ setup, we need to construct
the law of motion for the full state.

This is simpler than in the
previous setup, as we now have :math:`\bar b_{t+1} = u_t`.

Therefore:

.. math::

    x_{t+1} \equiv \begin{bmatrix} \bar b_{t+1} \\ z_{t+1} \end{bmatrix} = A_t x_t + B u_t + C_t w_{t+1}


where

.. math::  A_t = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & A_{22,t} \end{bmatrix} , \hspace{5mm} B = \begin{bmatrix} I \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} , \hspace{5mm} C = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ C_{2,t} \end{bmatrix}

This completes the mapping into a Markov jump LQ problem.

Restructuring as a Markov Jump Linear Quadratic Control Problem
============================================================================================

As with the previous model, we can use a function to map the primitives
of the model with restructuring into the matrices that the ``LQMarkov``
class requires:

.. code-block:: python3

    def LQ_markov_mapping_restruct(A22, C2, Ug, T, p_t, c=0):

        """
        Function which takes A22, C2, T, p_t, c and returns the
        required matrices for the LQMarkov model: A, B, C, R, Q, W
        Note, p_t should be a T by 1 matrix
        c is the rescheduling cost (a scalar)
        This version uses the condensed version of the endogenous state
        """

        # Make sure all matrices can be treated as 2D arrays
        A22 = np.atleast_2d(A22)
        C2 = np.atleast_2d(C2)
        Ug = np.atleast_2d(Ug)
        p_t = np.atleast_2d(p_t)

        # Find the number of states (z) and shocks (w)
        nz, nw = C2.shape

        # Create Sx, tSx, Ss, S_t matrices (tSx stands for \tilde S_x)
        Ss = np.hstack((np.eye(T-1), np.zeros((T-1, 1))))
        Sx = np.hstack((np.zeros((T-1, 1)), np.eye(T-1)))
        tSx = np.zeros((1, T))
        tSx[0, 0] = 1

        S_t = np.hstack((tSx + p_t.T @ Ss.T @ Sx, Ug))

        # Create A, B, C matrices
        A_T = np.hstack((np.zeros((T, T)), np.zeros((T, nz))))
        A_B = np.hstack((np.zeros((nz, T)), A22))
        A = np.vstack((A_T, A_B))

        B = np.vstack((np.eye(T), np.zeros((nz, T))))
        C = np.vstack((np.zeros((T, nw)), C2))

        # Create cost matrix Sc
        Sc = np.hstack((np.eye(T), np.zeros((T, nz))))

        # Create R_t, Q_t, W_t matrices

        R_c = S_t.T @ S_t + c * Sc.T @ Sc
        Q_c = p_t @ p_t.T + c * np.eye(T)
        W_c = -p_t @ S_t - c * Sc

        return A, B, C, R_c, Q_c, W_c

Example with Restructuring
--------------------------------

As an example of the model with restructuring, consider this model
where :math:`H = 3`.

We will assume that there are two Markov states, one with a
flatter yield curve, and one with a steeper yield curve.

In state 1,
prices are:

.. math::  p^1_{t,t+1} = 0.9695 \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm} p^1_{t,t+2} = 0.902 \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm} p^1_{t,t+3} = 0.8369

and in state 2, prices are:

.. math::  p^2_{t,t+1} = 0.9295 \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm} p^2_{t,t+2} = 0.902 \hspace{2mm} , \hspace{2mm} p^2_{t,t+3} = 0.8769

We will assume the same transition matrix and :math:`G_t` process as
above

.. code-block:: python3

    # New model parameters
    H = 3
    p1 = np.array([[0.9695], [0.902], [0.8369]])
    p2 = np.array([[0.9295], [0.902], [0.8769]])
    Pi = np.array([[0.9, 0.1], [0.1, 0.9]])

    # Put penalty on different issuance across maturities
    c2 = 0.5

    A1, B1, C1, R1, Q1, W1 = LQ_markov_mapping_restruct(A22, C_2, Ug, H, p1, c2)
    A2, B2, C2, R2, Q2, W2 = LQ_markov_mapping_restruct(A22, C_2, Ug, H, p2, c2)

    # Small penalties on debt required to implement no-Ponzi scheme
    R1[0, 0] = R1[0, 0] + 1e-9
    R1[1, 1] = R1[1, 1] + 1e-9
    R1[2, 2] = R1[2, 2] + 1e-9
    R2[0, 0] = R2[0, 0] + 1e-9
    R2[1, 1] = R2[1, 1] + 1e-9
    R2[2, 2] = R2[2, 2] + 1e-9

    # Construct lists of matrices
    As = [A1, A2]
    Bs = [B1, B2]
    Cs = [C1, C2]
    Rs = [R1, R2]
    Qs = [Q1, Q2]
    Ws = [W1, W2]

    # Construct and solve the model using the LQMarkov class
    lqm3 = qe.LQMarkov(Π, Qs, Rs, As, Bs, Cs=Cs, Ns=Ws, beta=β)
    lqm3.stationary_values()

    x0 = np.array([[5000, 5000, 5000, 1, 10]])
    x, u, w, t = lqm3.compute_sequence(x0, ts_length=300)

.. code-block:: python3

    # Plots of different maturities debt issuance

    fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4) = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(16, 4))
    ax1.plot(u[0, :])
    ax1.set_title('One-period debt issuance')
    ax1.set_xlabel('Time')
    ax2.plot(u[1, :])
    ax2.set_title('Two-period debt issuance')
    ax2.set_xlabel('Time')
    ax3.plot(u[2, :])
    ax3.set_title('Three-period debt issuance')
    ax3.set_xlabel('Time')
    ax4.plot(u[0, :] + u[1, :] + u[2, :])
    ax4.set_title('Total debt issuance')
    ax4.set_xlabel('Time')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

.. code-block:: python3

    # Plot share of debt issuance that is short-term

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot((u[0, :] / (u[0, :] + u[1, :] + u[2, :])))
    ax.set_title('One-period debt issuance share')
    ax.set_xlabel('Time')
    plt.show()
